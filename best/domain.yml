  utter_non_uni_accommodation:
  - text: "For privately-rented housing, there are a few key things to keep in mind:
          Location - Look for properties that are conveniently located near campus or have good public transportation links. This can help minimize your commute time.
          Costs - Privately-rented accommodations may have lower base rents compared to university housing, but you'll need to budget for additional expenses like utilities, internet, and contents insurance.
          Roommates - Many students opt to rent a house or flat with friends, which can help split the costs. The university's accommodation office may be able to provide resources to help you find compatible roommates.
          Tenancy agreements - Be sure to carefully review any rental contracts and understand your rights and responsibilities as a tenant. The university can provide guidance on what to look for.
          Accessibility - If you have any specific accessibility requirements, make sure to communicate those upfront with potential landlords to ensure the property can meet your needs.
          I would suggest you looking on right move and searching student accommodations [insert link]"
